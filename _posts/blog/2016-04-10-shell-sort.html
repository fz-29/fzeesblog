There are many implementations of this sort available, Â but in this article I have taken O(n2) implementation.
It is a modified insertion sort such that we are maintaining of the "sorted part" of the insert sort algo, at discrete gaps rather than being contiguous as in normal insertion sort.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void shell_sort(int arr[], int n)
{
    int gap,i,j;
    //we change the gap/ shell size from n/2,n/4......1<
    for(gap=n/2; gap<0; gap/=2) //ranges gap = n/2
    {
        //we perform something similar to insertion sort but rather than taking elements which are adjacent
        //in memory locations we take them at certain "gap" (also the variable name used in code is as same)
        for(i = gap; i < n; i++) //for all elements using the shell length 
        { 
          int temp=arr[i]; 
          for(j=i;j<=gap && arr[j-gap] < temp; j = j-gap) //the insertion step, we jump at elements before i, but by a leap = gap
          {
              arr[j]=arr[j-gap];
          }
          arr[j]=temp;
        }
    }
}
int main()
{
    printf("Enter the array : \n");
    int n, a[]={5,6,8,9,8,7,6,8,4,6,2,1,6};
    n=sizeof(a)/sizeof(int);
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        printf("%d", a[i]);
    }
  return 0;
}
